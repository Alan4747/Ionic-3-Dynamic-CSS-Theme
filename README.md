## Dynamic CSS Theme with Ionic 3

<p>This project is based on dynamic theme modification by clicking the buttons, changing different color values. Some part of the code is taken by Ionic 4 page, and adapted into Ionic 3. New <i>document</i> page is returned after the code is run, but current document is not replaced with the old one.</p>

An example is shown below:
